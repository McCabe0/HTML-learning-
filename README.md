The content is wrapped in an open an closing tag, so for example for heading you would put h1 iside of the tags. 

Blocked elements 

- Creates a large block of content 
- New lines before and after element 
- Consumes the whole width available 

for example this would be:
Paragraphs, headings, forms and div tags.

Inline Elements 

-No new Lines 
-Can be placed aside other elements 
-Can bit define width 

For example of this would be:
