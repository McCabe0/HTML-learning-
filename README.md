HTML uses Tag Elements 

The content is wrapped in an open an closing tag, so for example for heading you would put h1 iside of the tags. 

_Blocked elements_

* Creates a large block of content 
* New lines before and after element 
* Consumes the whole width available 

For example this would be:
Paragraphs, headings, forms and div tags.

 _Inline Elements_ 

* No new Lines 
* Can be placed aside other elements 
* Can bit define width 

For example of this would be:
Links, Bold, input and span tags

_Singleton Tags_

Has no closing tag, also called a void elements.

Img tag is an example of this, only the opening tag is needed, this is mainly used with attributte only tags such as img.
