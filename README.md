HTML uses Tag Elements 

The content is wrapped in an open an closing tag, so for example for heading you would put h1 iside of the tags. 

<b> Blocked elements </b>

- Creates a large block of content 
- New lines before and after element 
- Consumes the whole width available 

for example this would be:
Paragraphs, headings, forms and div tags.

<b> Inline Elements </b> 

-No new Lines 
-Can be placed aside other elements 
-Can bit define width 

For example of this would be:
Links,Bold,input and span tags

<b> Singleton Tags </b>

Has no closing tag, also called a void elements.

Img tag is an example of this, only the opening tag is needed, this is mainly used with attributte only tags such as img.
